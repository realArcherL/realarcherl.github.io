TL;DR I currently work as an AppSec Engineer at Loom (Now part of Atlassian).

I have worked in product security at "Make My Trip" (2021) and AppSec at Tinder (2022) in the past. I also pursued my passion for security through Bug Bounties where I found vulnerabilities at major companies such as GitHub, GitLab, and GlassDoor. I actively contribute to the security community through open-source projects.

Also, I completed my Master's in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University (May, 2023)
