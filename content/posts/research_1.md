### TL;DR: A little after-hours sleuthing exposed some path traversal bugs in popular open source projects. Productivity doesnâ€™t always stop at quitting time!

## Intoduction and Goal

On May 02, 2024 CISA released an advisory on <a target = "_blank" rel = "nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-eliminating-directory-traversal-vulnerabilities-software">"Secure by Design Alert: Eliminating Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities in Software"</a>.

<img src="/images/cisa-1.jpg" width="600" height="100" alt="CISA Path Traversal advisory" style="border:0.5px solid black">

<br>

Me and my **good friend [Kartik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartik-sharma-19081998/)** wanted to understand the gravity of this issue, so we started looking for issues in open source projects. The idea was not only to identify issues but also to help developers fix them either by suggesting solutions or raising a PR.

## Preventive measures

But before we dive in we wanted to cover some of the preventive measures suggested by CISA in the document [here](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/Secure_by_Design_Alert_Eliminating_Directory_Traversal_Vulnerabilities_in_Software_508c%20%283%29.pdf)

> 1. Consider generating a random identifier for each file and storing associated metadata separately <mark>(e.g., in a
>    database) rather than using user input when naming files.</mark>

One great example of this is by [actual-server](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server/tree/master): [here](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server/blob/master/src/app-sync.js#L287), they have a route called `/download-user-file`.

```js
app.get("/download-user-file", async (req, res) => {
  let accountDb = getAccountDb()
  let fileId = req.headers["x-actual-file-id"]
  if (typeof fileId !== "string") {
    // FIXME: Not sure how this cannot be a string when the header is
    // set.
    res.status(400).send("Single file ID is required")
    return
  }

  // Do some authentication
  let rows = accountDb.all(
    "SELECT id FROM files WHERE id = ? AND deleted = FALSE",
    [fileId]
  )
  if (rows.length === 0) {
    res.status(400).send("User or file not found")
    return
  }

  res.setHeader("Content-Disposition", `attachment;filename=${fileId}`)
  res.sendFile(getPathForUserFile(fileId))
})
```

The `fileID` is an ID generated by the database and is checked [against the database for existence first](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server/blob/master/src/app-sync.js#L298). If the value is found, only then is the file returned. In my opinion, having an additional check for "Path Traversal Input" would be redundant as the lookup from the database already verifies it. They are spot on with the secure design; they generated a random identifier and stored the metadata in the database.

> 2. In the case where the above approach is not taken, strictly limit the types of characters that can be supplied in file names, e.g., <mark> by restricting to alphanumeric characters </mark>. Also ensure that uploaded files do not have
>    executable permissions.

While it might not always be feasible or possible to use the first suggested preventive measure, the second point should be easy to follow and implement. This is what we ended up suggesting or adding in the code with our PRs to fix the vulnerabilities we found.

However, sometimes allowing or creating arbitrary files could be a feature like: CVE-2024-43797.

1. **Issue**:
   Path traversal occurred due to a lack of sanitization of user input for the file name. However, this was slightly different because the issue was with the arguments rather than the file name itself and a file with only ".png" extension could be written anywhere in the system.

(we don't have a CVE for this yet)

1. **Issue**: Path traversal occurred due to a lack of sanitization of user input for the file name. This issue sort of combined Unrestricted file upload vulnerability as well. I could upload any file, with any extension and content anywhere in the system.
   <mark><a target = "_blank" rel = "nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu/commit/8b81f0dd7e804859a776c51e09faec9e266af293#diff-4c734989f0bc8aa243e7010652fdbce84ec7ef54f2a7f5a598ece3fdf2f65812R455-R463">

3. **Fix**: Two fixes went here.
   1. First the dev used simple `if` statement to check what the `fileName` started with and ended with. <mark><a target = "_blank" rel = "nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu/commit/760d01ca71cb1bbb85cef64a61c9784fab7965a0#diff-4c734989f0bc8aa243e7010652fdbce84ec7ef54f2a7f5a598ece3fdf2f65812R664">Commit:760d01ca71cb1bbb85cef64a61c9784fab7965a0</a></mark>. This isn't a foolproof fix and still leaves room for path traversal vulnerabilities. Additionally, the file upload vulnerability still exists.
   2. The second and final fix was to check if the file matched the exact naming pattern defined by the regex. This ensures that even if a file with a `.xyz` extension is uploaded, it is saved with a `.webm` extension, else rejected.
      <mark><a target = "_blank" rel = "nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalksfu/commit/8414e4e108bc721d3ffbb48f87e95485b7650795">Commit:8414e4e108bc721d3ffbb48f87e95485b7650795</a></mark> which fixed the issue.

### 3. CVE-2024-43797

1. **Issue**: The web app allowed admins to store libraries, including various file types like .txt and .pdf, anywhere in the server's filesystem. However, this feature was intended only for admin users. We discovered an issue where non-admin users could exploit the endpoint to create arbitrary directories on the server. While not a traditional Path Traversal vulnerability, the impact was equivalent due to a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) flaw. <mark>[Commit(s)](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blame/1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80/server/controllers/LibraryController.js#L43-L47) which introduced the issue
2. **POC**: Here's a [video POC](https://www.loom.com/share/58f28fa857e44807857f19987ef1d696) of us reproducing the issue.

1. **Issue**: The CRM application allowed unauthenticated users to browse files from the `/public` endpoint.

   </a></mark>.

## Conclusion

Almost all of these issues happened because the developers used direct user input in the `path.join()` function without sanitizing it. This oversight seems to be the reason for the majority of the security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to follow security guidelines and best practices. The guidelines shared by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are very helpful in this regard. [Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) provides comprehensive resources and valuable insights and recommendations for securing web applications against such attacks.

By adhering to these guidelines and implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities in their applications.

## Closing Remarks

We aimed to understand the severity of the advisory by independently identifying issues and attempting to fix them. Our goal was also to avoid burdening open-source developers. As security engineers, we recognize the need to improve our reporting and remediation of security issues, given that OSS developers are not always sufficiently incentivized to undertake this demanding work. In each case, we discovered a security vulnerability, raised pull requests, and requested the developers to apply for CVEs on our behalf. This approach ensures we do not exaggerate any security issues or create unnecessary alarms for users, avoiding repeats [of similar situations](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/feross_overblown-cves-are-a-plague-on-open-source-activity-7217194376794398720-dh6b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

I hope you found this useful and educational. Thanks and Happy Hunting :)
